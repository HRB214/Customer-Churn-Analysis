Customer Churn Prediction & Interactive Dashboard
This is an end-to-end data science project that predicts customer churn using machine learning. The project covers the entire data science lifecycle, from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to model building, evaluation, and interpretation. The final results and insights are presented in a live, interactive web dashboard that includes an AI-powered strategy generator using the Gemini API.

Key Features
Comprehensive Analysis: Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in the Jupyter Notebook to uncover the key drivers of customer churn.

Machine Learning Pipeline: A complete preprocessing pipeline using scikit-learn that includes one-hot encoding, feature scaling, and SMOTE to handle class imbalance.

Model Comparison: Trains and evaluates three different classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) to select the best performer based on metrics like F1-Score and ROC AUC.

Interactive Dashboard: A single-page web application (index.html) built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Chart.js to visualize the project's findings in an intuitive way.

AI-Powered Insights: Integrates the Gemini API to brainstorm and generate creative, data-driven retention strategies on demand directly within the dashboard.

Detailed Report: The README.md file serves as a comprehensive project report, detailing each step of the process, the methodology, and actionable business recommendations.

Tech Stack
Analysis: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Imblearn
